### Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between climate-driven natural disasters and medical insurance premiums in the United States, focusing on demographic and geographic variations. Using data from FEMA, NOAA, and KFF, the study leverages SQL, Python, R, and Tableau for data preparation, statistical modeling, and visualization. 

The goal is to uncover how the financial burden of natural disasters correlates with medical insurance premiums, identify demographic and regional disparities, and provide insights to aid stakeholders in addressing these challenges.

### Project Objectives
_The primary goals of this project are to:_

1. **Quantify Relationships:** Analyze how natural disaster costs correlate with medical insurance premiums.
2. **Identify Risk Patterns:** Evaluate geographic areas at varying risk levels for natural disaster impacts.
3. **Examine Disparities:** Investigate how demographic groups are differently affected by premium increases across regions.
4. **Provide Actionable Insights:** Offer findings to inform policy decisions and resource allocation for stakeholders.

_By the end of this analysis, the expectation is to:_

1. **Present data-driven conclusions** on the economic implications of natural disasters for insured populations and plan providers.
2. **Highlight high-risk*regions and demographic groups** disproportionately affected by premium increases.
3. **Deliver visualizations and summaries** to enhance stakeholder understanding.
